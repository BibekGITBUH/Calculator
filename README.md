"# Calculator" 
This is a simple java application Scientific Calculator project that allows users to perform simple functions and operations. The calculator is designed to provide an easy and intuitive way to perform calculations without any unnecessary complexity.

Features:
Basic Arithmetic operations like:
Addition,Subtraction,Division,Multiplication.
And also some trignometric functions:
Sine function,
Cosine function,
Tan function.
They provide result of calculation in RAD form.
And finally Modulo,Exponential,Log,base-power and Factorial.

PreRequisite:
Java Development Kit(JDK)Download Java IDE(Integrated Development Environment) for compiling and running the code (eg: NETBeans,Eclipse,Intellij IDEA, or VScode).

Getting Started:
Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/BibekGITBUH/Calculator.git 
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Compile and run the ScientificCalc.java file to start calculator application.

Usage:
Enter the numbers you want to perform calculations on using the number buttons.
Click on the operation (+, -, *, /, %, sin, cos, tan, log, x^y & n!) you want to perform.
Enter the next set of numbers.
Click the "=" button to see the result of the calculation.
Examples
To add: 5 + 3 = 8
To subtract: 10 - 4 = 6
To multiply: 2 * 6 = 12
To divide: 15 / 3 = 5
To get Mod: 16 % 5= 1
To get power value: 2 x^y 2=4
Special case:
enter the angle or value and click sine,cos,tan,log and n!.

Acknowledgments:
This calculator project was inspired by the need for a simple yet functional calculator for everyday use.
Enjoy calculating!
